**archive** : Where old files are dumped but not deleted.

**scripts** : Where python scripts ready to be exectued are located.

**maps_generator** : The location of the code used to generate maps with or without signal.

The rest of the files correspond to code implementing machine learning algos to detect cosmic string signals. 

**NOTE** : Make sure you have downloaded the "data" folder, since the machine learning algos pull their datasets from this folder. To get the data, one can also run both the make_noise_maps.py and make_signal_maps.py located in the scripts directory.
