# CosmicStrings

A research project aimed at using CNNs to detect cosmic strings in E-mode and B-mode CMB polarization maps (simulated).

Please refer to the **CosmicStrings.pdf** file for an incomplete paper written on this research. Life circumstances prevented the completion of this research work. Further exploration should've been done with B-mode polarization maps to put a tighter constraint on string tension.
